# Pixel pet

## About
This code was generated by [CodeCraftAI](https://codecraft.name)

**User requests:**
create a app where the user is able to have a digital pixel pet that lives inside the app. User will need to login to web app that stores data of age and characteristics of pixel pet. Pet will have minimal animated characteristics that change and grow as the pet ages. User will be required to feed pet or else it will die after certain amount of time passed. All pets will start as eggs and take on randomized attributes at birth. Allow user to name pet. birth will take place 3 full days after egg incubation period. Pet will need to be fed at least once every 3 days or pet will die. The only objective of pixel pet is to keep pet alive. There is no maximum age of a pet. Use only HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Use pixel font.

## Project Plan

### **Project Plan: Pixel Pet Web Application**  

Below is a **simple, clear project plan** with main tasks and technical considerations to build the pixel pet web application:

---

### **Phase 1: Setup and Planning**  
**Tasks:**  
1. Define the project scope and review requirements.  
2. Set up the project structure (HTML, CSS, JS files).  
3. Choose a pixel font and art style for the interface and pet.  
4. Decide on the data storage method (local storage or IndexedDB).  

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility.  
- Organize CSS using a modular approach for easy maintenance.  
- Ensure all data storage logic is isolated in a separate JavaScript module.  

---

### **Phase 2: User Authentication**  
**Tasks:**  
1. Create a **Login/Signup Page** with a form.  
2. Implement client-side validation for inputs (e.g., username/password).  
3. Store user data securely (e.g., hashed passwords) in local storage or IndexedDB.  
4. Add logic to handle login and signup (check if the user exists, create a new entry).  

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Use unique identifiers (e.g., UUIDs) for each user.  
- Store user data in a structured format (e.g., JSON).  
- Ensure password hashing is implemented for security.  

---

### **Phase 3: Pixel Pet Lifecycle and Dashboard**  
**Tasks:**  
1. Create a **Pet Dashboard** to display the pet’s state (egg, alive, dead).  
2. Implement the egg incubation logic (3-day timer).  
3. Add randomized pet attributes (color, pattern, size) upon hatching.  
4. Allow users to name their pet and store this data persistently.  

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Use JavaScript’s `Date` object to track time for incubation.  
- Generate random attributes using `Math.random()`.  
- Store pet details (e.g., age, attributes) in local storage.  

---

### **Phase 4: Pet Survival Mechanics**  
**Tasks:**  
1. Add a “Feed” button and implement feeding logic (track last feeding time).  
2. Create a 3-day countdown timer for feeding.  
3. Implement logic to determine if the pet dies (if not fed within 3 days).  
4. Allow users to restart the pet lifecycle if the pet dies.  

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Use `setTimeout` or `setInterval` for countdown timers.  
- Store feeding times persistently and calculate elapsed time.  
- Provide a reset button to clear pet data and start over.  

---

### **Phase 5: Pet Aging and Visual Evolution**  
**Tasks:**  
1. Implement pet aging logic (e.g., age increases daily).  
2. Create visual changes based on age (e.g., size, animations).  
3. Add minimal animations (e.g., blinking, moving) using CSS and JavaScript.  

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Use CSS keyframes for animations.  
- Store the pet’s age persistently and update it daily.  
- Use conditional rendering in JavaScript to change pet visuals.  

---

### **Phase 6: Styling and Final Touches**  
**Tasks:**  
1. Apply a pixel art style to the pet and interface.  
2. Use a pixel font for all text.  
3. Ensure the app is responsive and works across devices.  
4. Test the app thoroughly for bugs and edge cases.  

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Use CSS media queries for responsiveness.  
- Test data persistence across sessions and browsers.  
- Optimize the app’s performance (e.g., minimize DOM manipulations).

### **Deliverables Timeline**  
| **Phase**            | **Duration** | **Deliverables**                                      |  
|-----------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|  
| Setup and Planning    | 1 Day        | Project structure, pixel font, art style              |  
| User Authentication   | 2 Days       | Login/Signup Page, secure storage                     |  
| Pixel Pet Lifecycle   | 3 Days       | Pet Dashboard, egg incubation, randomized attributes  |  
| Pet Survival Mechanics| 2 Days       | Feeding logic, death/reset functionality              |  
| Pet Aging and Evolution| 3 Days      | Aging logic, visual changes, animations                |  
| Styling and Final T   | 2 Days       | Pixel art, pixel font, responsiveness, testing         |  

**Total Estimated Time:** 13 Days  

---

### **Risk Management**  
1. **Data Loss:** Ensure data is backed up frequently during testing.  
2. **Deadlines:** Buffer time for unexpected issues (e.g., 1-2 extra days).  
3. **Browser Compatibility:** Test the app on multiple browsers.
